Credit Card Fraud Detection System

My project is about developing a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning and Python. The goal of the project is to use statistical algorithms and data analysis techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and minimize financial losses for credit card issuers.

I collected and preprocessed a large dataset of credit card transactions, and used machine learning techniques such as logistic regression to train a predictive model on the data. I evaluated the performance of the model using various performance metrics, and fine-tuned the model to optimize its accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false alarms for genuine transactions.

The project required a strong understanding of data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, and statistical analysis, as well as the ability to effectively use the Python programming language and data science libraries.

Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience that gave me hands-on experience in using machine learning for real-world applications, and the opportunity to develop my skills in data analysis, modeling, and programming.
